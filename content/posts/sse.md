## Certification of Appreciation

This page is dedicated to my friend *Sim Shang En*

He may be part of the reason i rage quit computing, but also part of the reason I'm back.

Thanks for being a pillar of support in my life â€“ be it tech or non-tech.

He is also the reason this site exists today. (as of writing: hopefully will exist soon)

CHEERS

## my favourite films

Inspired by my friend [Marianna](https://annacao.com), here is a list of my favourite shows.

- gilmore girls
- never have i ever
- love, actually
- legally blonde
- I realised that listing my favourite films is a harder than excpected task. to be updated

As you can see, I am a sucker for rom-coms. some criteria i use to rate shows include 1. how much it made me cry and 2. how fast the story goes. I hate draggy shows :thumbsdown
